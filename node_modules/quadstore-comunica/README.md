# Comunica for quadstore

A SPARQL query engine for [quadstore][i0] built on the [Comunica][i1]
framework and implementing the [RDF/JS Query specification][i3].

Practical examples of how to use the engine can be found in [`/examples`][i6].
These examples complement the [RDF/JS Query specification][i3] and 
[Comunica's documentation][i5]. See also the [quadstore][i0] and [comunica][i1]
repositories.

For further information, please refer to [quadstore's repository][i7].

## Basic usage

```typescript
import { MemoryLevel } from 'memory-level';
import { DataFactory } from 'rdf-data-factory';
import { Quadstore } from 'quadstore';
import { Engine } from 'quadstore-comunica';

const backend = new MemoryLevel();
const df = new DataFactory();
const store = new Quadstore({ backend, dataFactory: df });
const engine = new Engine(store);

const query = await engine.query('SELECT * {?s ?p ?o}');
const bindingsStream = await query.execute();
```

## SPARQL coverage

We're using the [`rdf-test-suite`][s4] package to validate our
support for SPARQL queries against official test suites published by the W3C.

We're currently testing against the following manifests:

- [SPARQL 1.1][s2] / [QUERY][s3]: 289/290 (99.6%) tests passing
- [SPARQL 1.1][s2] / [UPDATE][s5]: 156/156 (100%) tests passing
