## Example of basic usage

```typescript
import {MemoryLevel} from 'memory-level';
import {DataFactory} from 'rdf-data-factory';
import {Quadstore} from 'quadstore';
import {Engine} from 'quadstore-comunica';

// Any implementation of AbstractLevelDOWN can be used.
// For server-side persistence, use `leveldown` or `rocksdb`.
const backend = new MemoryLevel();

// Implementation of the RDF/JS DataFactory interface
const df = new DataFactory();           

// Store and query engine are separate modules
const store = new Quadstore({backend, dataFactory: df});
const engine = new Engine(store);

// Put a single quad into the store using Quadstore's API
store.put(df.quad(                      
  df.namedNode('http://example.com/subject'),
  df.namedNode('http://example.com/predicate'),
  df.namedNode('http://example.com/object'),
  df.defaultGraph(),
));

// Retrieves all quads using Quadstore's API  
const { items } = await store.get({});

// Retrieves all quads using RDF/JS Stream interfaces
const quadsStream = store.match(undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined);

// Queries the store via RDF/JS Query interfaces
const query = await engine.query('SELECT * {?s ?p ?o}');
const bindingsStream = await query.execute();
```

## Usage

### Storage backends

`quadstore` can work with any storage backend that implements the 
[AbstractLevel interface][db1]. An incomplete list of available backends
is available at [level/awesome#stores][db6].

Our test suite focuses on the following backends:

- [`classic-level`][db2] for persistent storage using [LevelDB][db0]
- [`memory-level`][db3] for volatile in-memory storage using red-black trees
- ~~[`rocksdb`][db4] for persistent storage using [RocksDB][db5]~~
  - waiting for the `rocks-level` package to be published

[db0]: http://leveldb.org
[db1]: https://github.com/Level/abstract-level
[db2]: https://github.com/level/classic-level
[db3]: https://github.com/level/memory-level
[db4]: https://github.com/level/rocksdb
[db5]: https://rocksdb.org
[db6]: https://github.com/level/awesome#stores

### Data model and return values

Except for those related to the [RDF/JS stream interfaces][dm-2], `quadstore`'s
API is promise-based and all methods return objects that include both the actual
query results and the relevant metadata.

Objects returned by `quadstore`'s APIs have the `type` property set to one of
the following values:

- `"VOID"` - when there's no data returned by the database, such as with the
  `put` method;
- `"QUADS"` - when a query returns a collection of quads;
- `"APPROXIMATE_SIZE"` - when a query returns an approximate count of how many
  matching items are present.

For those methods that return objects with the `type` property set to
`"QUADS"`, `quadstore` provides query results either in streaming mode or in
non-streaming mode. 
  
Streaming methods such as `getStream` return objects with the `iterator`
property set to an instance of [`AsyncIterator`][dm-4], an implementation of a
subset of the `stream.Readable` interface.

Non-streaming methods such as `get` return objects with the `items` property
set to an array of quads.

Quads are returned as and expected to be instances of the
 [RDF/JS `Quad` interface][dm-1] as produced by the implementation of the 
 [RDF/JS `DataFactory` interface][dm-1] passed to the `Quadstore` constructor.

Matching patterns, such as those used in the `get` and `getStream` methods, 
are expected to be maps of term names to instances of the
[RDF/JS Term interface][dm-1].

### Access to the backend

The backend of a `quadstore` can be accessed with the `db` property, to perform
additional storage operations independently of quads.

In order to perform write operations atomically with quad storage, the `put`,
`multiPut`, `del`, `multiDel`, `patch` and `multiPatch` methods accept a
`preWrite` option which defines a procedure to augment the batch, as in the
following example:

```js
await store.put(dataFactory.quad(/* ... */), {
  preWrite: batch => batch.put('my.key', Buffer.from('my.value'))
});
```

### Quadstore class

```js
const Quadstore = require('quadstore').Quadstore;
const store = new Quadstore(opts);
```

Instantiates a new store. Supported properties for the `opts` argument 
are:

##### opts.backend

The `opts.backend` option **must** be an instance of a leveldb backend.
See [storage backends](#storage-backends).

##### opts.dataFactory

The `dataFactory` option *must* be an implementation of the 
[RDF/JS DataFactory interface][dm-1]. Some of the available
implementations: 

- [rdf-data-factory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdf-data-factory)
- [@rdfjs/data-model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rdfjs/data-model)
- [N3.DataFactory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n3)

##### opts.indexes

The `opts.indexes` option allows users to configure which indexes will be used
by the store. If not set, the store will default to the following indexes:

```js
[
  ['subject', 'predicate', 'object', 'graph'],
  ['object', 'graph', 'subject', 'predicate'],
  ['graph', 'subject', 'predicate', 'object'],
  ['object', 'subject', 'predicate', 'graph'],
  ['predicate', 'object', 'graph', 'subject'],
  ['graph', 'predicate', 'object', 'subject'],
]; 
```

This option, if present, **must** be set to an array of term arrays, each of 
which **must** represent one of the 24 possible permutations of the four terms 
`subject`, `predicate`, `object` and `graph`. Partial indexes are not 
supported.

The store will automatically select which index(es) to use for a given query 
based on the available indexes and the query itself. **If no suitable index is
found for a given query, the store will throw an error**.

##### opts.prefixes

Also, `Quadstore` can be configured with a `prefixes` object that defines a
reversible mapping of IRIs to abbreviated forms, with the intention of reducing
the storage cost where common HTTP prefixes are known in advance.

The `prefixes` object defines a bijection using two functions `expandTerm` and
`compactIri`, both of which take a string parameter and return a string, as in
the following example:

```js
opts.prefixes = {
  expandTerm: term => term.replace(/^ex:/, 'http://example.com/'),
  compactIri: iri => iri.replace(/^http:\/\/example\.com\//, 'ex:'),
}
```

This will replace the IRI `http://example.com/a` with `ex:a` in storage.

### Quadstore.prototype.open()

This method opens the store and throws if the open operation fails for any reason.

### Quadstore.prototype.close()

This method closes the store and throws if the open operation fails for any reason.

### Quadstore.prototype.get()

```js
const pattern = {graph: dataFactory.namedNode('ex://g')};
const { items } = await store.get(pattern);
```

Returns an array of all quads within the store matching the specified terms.

This method also accepts an optional `opts` parameter with the following 
optional properties:

- `opts.order`: array of term names (e.g. `['object']`) that represents the
  desired ordering criteria of returned quads. Equivalent to the `ORDER BY`
  clause in `SQL`.
- `opts.reverse`: boolean value that indicates whether to return quads in 
  ascending or descending order. Equivalent to `ASC` / `DESC` modifiers in
  `SQL`.
- `opts.limit`: limit the number of returned quads to the specified value.
  Equivalent to `LIMIT` clause in `SQL`.

### Range matching

`quadstore` supports range-based matching in addition to value-based matching. 
Ranges can be defined using the `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` properties: 

```js
const pattern = {
  object: {
    termType: 'Range',
    gt: dataFactory.literal('7', 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer')
  }
};
const { items } = await store.get(matchTerms);
```
    
Values for literal terms with the following numeric datatypes are matched
against their numerical values rather than their literal representations:

```
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonPositiveInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#negativeInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#long
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#short
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#byte
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#nonNegativeInteger
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedLong
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedInt
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedShort
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedByte
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#positiveInteger
```

This is also the case for terms with the following date/time datatypes:

```
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime
```

### Quadstore.prototype.put()

## Blank nodes and quad scoping

Blank nodes are defined as _existential_ variables in that they merely indicate
the existence of an entity rather than act as references to the entity itself.

While the semantics of blank nodes [can][bnode-disc-1] [be][bnode-disc-2]
[rather][bnode-disc-3] [confusing][bnode-disc-4], one of the most practical 
consequences of their definition is that two blank nodes having the same label
may not refer to the same entity unless both nodes come from the same logical
set of quads.

As an example, here's two JSON-LD documents converted to N-Quads using the  
[JSON-LD playground][jsonld-plg]:

```json
{
  "@id": "http://example.com/bob",
  "foaf:knows": {
    "foaf:name": "Alice"
  }
}
```

```
<http://example.com/bob> <foaf:knows> _:b0 .
_:b0 <foaf:name> "Alice" .
```

```json
{
  "@id": "http://example.com/alice",
  "foaf:knows": {
    "foaf:name": "Bob"
  }
}
```

```
<http://example.com/alice> <foaf:knows> _:b0 .
_:b0 <foaf:name> "Bob" .
```

The N-Quads equivalent for both of these documents contains a blank node with
the `b0` label. However, although the label is the same, these blank nodes
indicate the existence of two different entities. Intuitively, we can say that
a blank node is scoped to the logical grouping of quads that contains it, be it
a single quad, a document or a stream.

As quadstore treats all write operations as if they were happening within the 
same scope, importing these two sets of quads would result in a collision of 
two unrelated blank nodes, leading to a corrupted dataset. 

A good way to address these issues is to skolemize [skolemize][skolem-def] all 
blank nodes into IRIs / named nodes. However, this is not always possible and
/ or practical.

The [`initScope()`](#quadstoreprototypeinitscope) method returns a `Scope`
instance which can be passed to the `put`, `multiPut` and `putStream` methods. 
When doing so, quadstore will replace each occurrence of a given blank node 
with a different blank node having a randomly-generated label, preventing blank
node collisions.

Each `Scope` instance keeps an internal cache of mappings between previously
encountered blank nodes and their replacements, so that it is able to always 
return the same replacement blank node for a given label. Each new mapping is
atomically persisted to the store together with its originating quad, leading
each scope to be incrementally persisted to the store consistently with each 
successful `put` and `multiPut` operation. This allows scopes to be re-used
even across process restarts via the 
[`loadScope()`](#quadstoreprototypeloadscope) method.

### Quadstore.prototype.initScope()

Initializes a new, empty scope.

```js
const scope = await store.initScope();
await store.put(quad, { scope });
await store.multiPut(quads, { scope });
await store.putStream(stream, { scope });
```

### Quadstore.prototype.loadScope()

Each `Scope` instance has an `.id` property that acts as its unique identifier.
The `loadScope()` method can be used to re-hydrate a scope through its `.id`: 

```js
const scope = await store.initScope();
/* store scope.id somewhere */
```

```js
/* read the previously-stored scope.id */
const scope = await store.loadScope(scopeId);
```

### Quadstore.prototype.deleteScope()

Deletes all mappings of a given scope from the store.

```js
const scope = await store.initScope();
/* ... */
await store.deleteScope(scope.id);
```

### Quadstore.prototype.deleteAllScopes()

Deletes all mappings of all scopes from the store.

```js
await store.deleteAllScopes();
```

## SPARQL

SPARQL queries can be executed against a `Quadstore` instance using any query
engine capable of querying across RDF/JS data sources.

An example of one such engine is [quadstore-comunica][c2], an engine built as
a custom distribution and configuration of [Comunica][c1] that implements the
[RDF/JS Query spec][c4].:

> Comunica is a knowledge graph querying framework. [...] Comunica is a meta
> query engine using which query engines can be created. It does this by
> providing a set of modules that can be wired together in a flexible manner.
> [...] Its primary goal is executing SPARQL queries over one or more
> interfaces.

In time, [quadstore-comunica][c2] will be extended with custom query modules
that will optimize query performance by pushing some matching and ordering
operations down to quadstore itself. 

```typescript
import {MemoryLevel} from 'memory-level';
import {DataFactory} from 'rdf-data-factory';
import {Quadstore} from 'quadstore';
import {Engine} from 'quadstore-comunica';

const backend = new MemoryLevel();
const df = new DataFactory();
const store = new Quadstore({backend, dataFactory: df});
const engine = new Engine(store);

const query = await engine.query('SELECT * {?s ?p ?o}');
const bindingsStream = await query.execute();
```

## Browser usage

The [`browser-level`][b1] backend for levelDB offers support for browser-side
persistent storage. 

`quadstore` can be bundled for browser-side usage via Webpack, preferably using
version 5.x. The reference [quadstore-browser][b0] is meant to help in getting 
to a working Webpack configuration and also hosts a pre-built bundle with everything
that is required to use `quadstore` in browsers.

[b1]: https://github.com/Level/browser-level

## Deno usage

`quadstore` can be used with the [Deno][d0] runtime via the [skypack.dev][d1] 
CDN:

```ts
import { DataFactory } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rdf-data-factory@1.1.1';
import { Quadstore } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/quadstore@11.0.6';
import { MemoryLevel } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/memory-level@1.0.0';
import { Engine } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/quadstore-comunica@3.0.7';

const backend = new MemoryLevel();
const dataFactory = new DataFactory();
const store = new Quadstore({ backend, dataFactory });
const engine = new Engine(store);

await store.open();
await store.put(dataFactory.quad(
        dataFactory.namedNode('ex://s'),
        dataFactory.namedNode('ex://p'),
        dataFactory.namedNode('ex://o'),
));
const stream = await engine.queryBindings('SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }');
stream.on('data', (bindings) => console.log(bindings));
```

Example usage:

```shell
deno run quadstore-test.ts
```
